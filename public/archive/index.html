            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>What else can I say about myself? I am a web developer/programmer/computer nerd.</p>
            <p>The only reason I haven't been hired is because I know what the going pay rate is for the job, I see how employers flinch when I tell them how much it will cost to do things, and I watch as projects die when I ask them to provide me media assets (videos, pictures, even written content) that they need to make their website a reality but never do it. Yet somehow the position turns from "web developer" into "social media manager" as if I'm going to spend my ever waking hour updating their social media profile when Facebook has a flawless interface that they should be able to use.</p>
            <p>My point is, you just can't simply hire a computer jockey, expect them to write a website without providing adequate content to put on it. Also, employers need to stop trying to con web developerss into being an independent contractors, or string out the job indefintely by making them a "social media manager", and expect them to paid in gratitude.</p>
            <p>If It were up to me, web developers would have unionized back in the late 1990s, eschewed independent contracting and "the gig economy", and preserved search engine website from being taken over by bumbling corporate executives and hegemonic billionaires who've eliminated any diversity and fair competition in this industry.</p>
            <p>This would also squash any accusations of political bias claiming "Big Tech is trying to silence us" when <a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/texas-politics/do-facebook-and-twitter-silence-conservatives-data-shows-they-actually-dominate/">the data proves that to be patently false</a>, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2021/02/01/nyu-conservative-claims-tech-bias-disinformation">a form of disinformation</a>, and <a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/peace_publications/democracy/the-big-lie-and-big-tech.pdf">part of "The Big Lie"</a>. Frankly, the problem isn't that the people who claim "Big Tech is trying to censor us", but that their policies just suck, everyone is sick of their crap, and it is being tuned out because nobody wants it.</p><p><strong>The search engines are doing what they are designed to do: putting the results that are in high demand on top and the ones that people aren't interested in down at the bottom.</strong>  And if their <em>promoted</em> "content" (advertisements) isn't being clicked on, despite the billions of dollars being spent to try and influence people, its because nobody is interested in that too.</p>
            <p>There needs to be a major attitude adjustment and the infantile people whose greed is not satisfied with having the majority of the influence need to be replace with responsible mature adults.</p>
            <p>So quit making excuses for not hiring people either because of costs or the polluted political atmosphere, and hire them for what they are worth!</p>
